# tsuml2-vscode README

Generate UML diagram for your TypeScript applications.
And view them directly in VS Code - powered by [nomnoml](https://nomnoml.com/).

## Features

TsUML2 works offline, so no third party servers are involved. It supports
- classes
- interfaces
- enums
- types

### Export to Mermaid and nomnoml DSL
You can export a class diagram to [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) and
[nomnoml](https://nomnoml.com/) language.

> This is pretty handy for embedding (interactive) diagrams directly into markdown.
(i.e.: [embedding diagrams in github markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams) )

Use it for further refinement of class diagrams in the mermaid / nomnoml editors.
